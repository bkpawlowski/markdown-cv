## Employment summary
`2020 - present`

__Software architect/Technical Team leader, Decerto sp. z o.o.; Warsaw__

Initially as a team of 5 people, we have taken maintenance and development of micro-service oriented IT system for life and property insurance.

As a team we have so far:

• automated existing deployment process in jenkins - existing jenkins pipeline was only capable of building artifacts. These artifacts were meant to be deployed by hand with ansible scripts executed from CLI.

• built simple gitlab based CI/CD docker-in-docker framework.

• completely rewritten existing liferay based frontoffice sales portal using angular and spring framework

• optimized insurance product retrieval process reducing time(for complex products it wend down from 120s to 200ms) and bandwith usage (for complex products from 500MB to 1MB)

• optimized premium calculation process reducing calculation time (for complex products from nearly 240s to 3-5s)

• introduced core services redundancy to reduce customer's general services unavailability

• managed to transfer infrastructure between co-locations and migrate VMs from centos 7 to RockyLinux 9 and update software components

• managed to implement services and infrastructure monitoring using checkmk, opentelemetry, prometheus, zipkin and grafana

• split insurance system, infrastructure and database(data had to be removed from each-other) to life and property according to customer requirements.

• built and deployed around 20 additional standalone, low latency microservices around existing core system.

• introduced feature flags for releasing new features - rollouts are on their way.

• cleaned up sales process from unnecessary (from business sales perspective) bloat processes that were negatively affecting sales.

• configured internal DNS and ssl enforcing reverse proxies for serving internal customer's web applications with domain names for productive and non-productive environments.
